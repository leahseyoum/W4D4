# Write a Towers of Hanoi game.

# Keep three arrays, which represent the piles of discs. Pick a representation of the discs to store in the arrays, maybe just a number representing their size. Don't worry too much about making the user interface pretty.

# In a loop, prompt the user (using gets). Ask what pile to select a disc from and where to put it.

# After each move, check to see if they have succeeded in moving all the discs to the final pile. If so, they win!

# Note: Don't worry about testing the UI. Testing console I/O is tricky (i.e., don't bother checking gets or puts). Focus on:

# #move
# #won?
